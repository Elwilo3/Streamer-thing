# Streamer-thing Chat Stats
Streamer-thing Chat Stats is a program that analyzes chat data for a Twitch streamer of your choice and generates statistics. You can use this program to gain insights into the chat behavior and preferences of your favorite streamers and their communities. (The program is basic and messy so ask questions if you need help:))

To use this program, you will need to download chat data from RechatTool, a tool that allows you to download chat messages from past Twitch broadcasts. 
You can find RechatTool here: https://github.com/jdpurcell/RechatTool

What the Program Can Do
The program can currently find the following statistics from the chat data:

Top Emotes: The most used emotes in the chat, along with their frequency.
Top Chatters: The most active chatters in the chat, along with their number of messages.
Number of Unique Chatters: The total number of different chatters who participated in the chat.
Frequency per Chatter: The average number of messages sent by each chatter.
