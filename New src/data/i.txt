[03:47:48] FANGOlives: hemingway's famous response when faulkner 'insulted' him for 'never having to reach for a dictionary' when reading his stories: "Poor Faulkner. Does he really think big emotions come from big words? He thinks I don’t know the ten-dollar words. I know them all right. But there are older and simpler and better words, and those are the ones I use."
